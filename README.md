A Class is a generlaized description of Objects which fit into the description.
For instance, 
                a Class of Humans will fit Male, Female, Boy, Girl, Bob, Alice, etc.
                a Class of Friuts will fit Mango, Orange, Apple, Tangarin, Grape, etc.

And Object is an instance of a Class. So an instance of a Class of Humans could be "Bob or Alice".

In js, we define as
                    Class Human{
                        //code
                    }
In js, de create an Object by instanciating a Class:
                    const ObjectName = new ClassName;
